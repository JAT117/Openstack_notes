#yum install rabbitmq-server

#systemctl enable rabbitmq-server.service
#systemctl start rabbitmq-server.service

//Add the openstack user:
#rabbitmqctl add_user openstack password

//Permit configuration, write, and read access for the openstack user:
#rabbitmqctl set_permissions openstack ".*" ".*" ".*"

#yum install memcached python-memcached

nano /etc/memcached.conf
OPTIONS="-l 127.0.0.1,::1,controller"

Memcached
--------

The Identity service authentication mechanism for services uses Memcached to cache tokens. 
The memcached service typically runs on the controller node. 
For production deployments, we recommend enabling a combination of firewalling, authentication, and encryption to secure it.


# yum install memcached python-memcached
Edit the /etc/sysconfig/memcached file and complete the following actions:

Configure the service to use the management IP address of the controller node. This is to enable access by other nodes via the management network:

OPTIONS="-l 127.0.0.1,::1,controller"

 Note Change the existing line OPTIONS="-l 127.0.0.1,::1".

Finalize installation
Start the Memcached service and configure it to start when the system boots:

# systemctl enable memcached.service
# systemctl start memcached.service
