IP tables and Linux Firewalls
----------------------------------
Chains:
	Input 
	Forward
	Output
	
Different services is used for different protocols as:
	iptables applies to IPv4.
	ip6tables applies to IPv6.
	arptables applies to ARP.
	ebtables applies to Ethernet Frames.

IPTables main files are:
	/etc/init.d/iptables – init script to start|stop|restart and save rulesets.
	/etc/sysconfig/iptables – where Rulesets are saved.
	/sbin/iptables – binary.

There are at present three tables:
	Filter
	NAT
	Mangle

Check status:
	iptables -nLv
	iptables -L
	iptables -L -v
	iptables -L | grep policy

Depriciated:
	/etc/init.d/iptables start 
	/etc/init.d/iptables stop
	/etc/init.d/iptables restart


Firewalld configuration details are not stored in /etc/sysconfig/iptables. 
Instead, configuration details are stored in various files in the /usr/lib/firewalld and /etc/firewalld directories.

Systemd:
	systemctl disable firewalld
	systemctl stop firewalld

yum install iptables-services

Enable the service at boot-time:

systemctl enable iptables
Managing the service

systemctl [stop|start|restart] iptables

# systemctl disable NetworkManager
# systemctl stop NetworkManager

# systemctl enable network
# systemctl start network

to delete IPtable rules (flush) run: iptables -F
